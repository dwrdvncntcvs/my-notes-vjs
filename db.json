      "details": "I didn't realize before that it is really hard to code in Vanilla JavaScript. I think it's because that I started using it for creating Backend application. However, it is very hard to use in client side application. It can be very complex to create components of a page especially when trying to create a single page application.\n\nThese are my realizations when I try to create one for myself. I see that JS is hard but it allows me to learn more about the language that I always use. Client side and backend applications are two different but interesting things. Now I know why JavaScript has so many frameworks.",
